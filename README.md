In this assignment we had to edit some of the coding that was given to us. The coding that we used mostly involved sprites which is 2D animation. This is the next step that will allow us to make our own video game. In the first file I changed the coding to from line 23 that will make the program randomly print out 20 different animals. The next file makes it so another animal could have text bubble along with another animal. The last file allows a person to use a mouse in order to move the moose around the screen.
